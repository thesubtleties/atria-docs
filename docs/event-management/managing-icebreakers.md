# Managing Icebreakers

Set up conversation starters that help attendees network and connect with each other at your event.

## Overview

Icebreakers are pre-written messages that attendees can use to start conversations with other event participants. They reduce social friction and encourage networking.

**Access:** Event Settings → Networking Settings

**What they do:**
- Provide conversation starters for shy or uncertain attendees
- Set a friendly, professional tone for networking
- Make it easy to initiate connections
- Encourage structured, purposeful networking

**How attendees use them:**
- Select an icebreaker from a list
- Send it to another attendee with one click
- Start a conversation without awkwardness

:::info Minimum Required
Your event must have **at least 1 icebreaker**. You cannot save your event settings without at least one icebreaker message.

## Icebreaker Best Practices

### Writing Effective Icebreakers

**Good icebreakers:**
- Are friendly and welcoming
- Reference the event or shared context
- Open-ended (encourage response)
- Brief enough to read quickly
- Professional but not formal
- Inclusive and positive

**Examples:**
- ✓ "What brings you to this event? I'd love to learn more about your work!"
- ✓ "I saw we have similar interests. Would you like to connect?"
- ✓ "Are you attending any sessions on [topic]? Let's chat about it!"

**Avoid:**
- ✗ "Hi" (too brief, not engaging)
- ✗ "Let's network" (too vague)
- ✗ Very long messages (over 200 characters)
- ✗ Overly casual or unprofessional language
- ✗ Messages that sound like spam or sales pitches

### How Many Icebreakers?

**Recommended:** 5-10 icebreakers

**Why this range:**
- Provides variety without overwhelming attendees
- Covers different networking situations
- Allows for different tones and approaches
- Keeps the selection scannable

**You can have:**
- Minimum: 1 (required)
- Maximum: No hard limit (unlimited)
- Practical limit: 15-20 before it becomes too many

### Types of Icebreakers to Include

**Mix different approaches:**

1. **Interest-based**
   - "I noticed we're both interested in [topic]. Would you like to connect?"

2. **Session-based**
   - "Are you attending the session on [topic]? Let's discuss!"

3. **General networking**
   - "I'd love to hear about your work. Can we connect?"

4. **Event-specific**
   - "What are you hoping to get out of this event?"

5. **Profile-based**
   - "I saw your background in [field] and would love to learn more!"

### Tailoring to Your Event

**Consider your event type:**

**Professional Conference:**
- More formal, industry-focused
- Reference sessions, speakers, topics
- Emphasize learning and knowledge-sharing

**Networking Event:**
- Emphasize connections and relationships
- Focus on common interests
- Encourage ongoing conversation

**Workshop/Training:**
- Focus on learning together
- Emphasize collaboration
- Reference skills or topics being taught

**Community Event:**
- More casual and friendly
- Emphasize shared interests or values
- Build community feeling

## Common Scenarios

### Scenario 1: Setting Up Icebreakers for a New Event

**Goal:** Create a good set of icebreakers before launch

**Steps:**
1. Go to Event Settings → Networking Settings
2. Click "+ Add Message" for each icebreaker
3. Create 5-8 varied messages:
   - 2 interest-based
   - 2 session-based
   - 2 general networking
   - 1-2 event-specific
4. Reorder them from most to least relevant
5. Click "Save Changes"

### Scenario 2: Updating Icebreakers During an Event

**Goal:** Add more relevant icebreakers based on event activity

**Steps:**
1. Monitor which sessions or topics are most popular
2. Add new icebreakers referencing those topics
3. Example: "The AI panel was fascinating! Did you attend? Let's discuss!"
4. Reorder to put new ones near the top
5. Save changes

### Scenario 3: Refreshing Icebreakers for Different Event Types

**Goal:** Tailor icebreakers to match event format

**Professional Tech Conference:**
- "What technologies are you most excited to learn about?"
- "I saw your background in [tech area]. Would love to connect!"
- "Are you attending the keynote on [topic]? Let's chat after!"

**Casual Networking Meetup:**
- "Hey! What brings you to this meetup?"
- "I'd love to hear about what you're working on!"
- "Have you been to one of these before? Let's connect!"

### Scenario 4: Fixing Low-Quality Icebreakers

**Goal:** Improve icebreakers that aren't working well

**Signs of poor icebreakers:**
- Too short or vague
- Sound spammy or sales-y
- Don't relate to the event
- Too formal or too casual for your audience

**Fix:**
1. Review your current icebreakers
2. Edit weak ones to be more specific and engaging
3. Delete any that don't fit your event
4. Add new ones based on best practices
5. Save changes

### Scenario 5: Accidentally Deleted All Icebreakers

**Goal:** Recover from deleting all icebreakers

**What happens:**
- You can't delete the last icebreaker (protected)
- If you try to save with zero, you'll get an error
- "At least one icebreaker message is required"

**Solution:**
- The validation prevents saving with zero
- Keep at least one, then edit or replace it

---

## Troubleshooting

### Can't Save Without an Icebreaker

**Problem:** Error message "At least one icebreaker message is required"

**Solution:**
- You must have at least 1 icebreaker
- Add a new icebreaker before deleting the last one
- Or keep the last one and edit it instead

### Changes Not Saving

**Problem:** Modified icebreakers but attendees don't see changes

**Solutions:**
- Make sure you clicked **Save Changes** at the bottom
- Changes are not applied until you save
- Check for validation errors preventing save
- Try refreshing the page and check if changes persisted

### Message Too Short Error

**Problem:** "Icebreaker message must be at least 10 characters"

**Solution:**
- Icebreakers must be at least 10 characters long
- Expand your message to be more descriptive
- Example: "Hi!" → "Hi! I'd love to connect and chat!"

### Can't Delete an Icebreaker

**Problem:** Delete option not working

**Solutions:**
- If it's the last icebreaker, you can't delete it (minimum 1 required)
- Add a new one first, then delete the old one
- Check your permissions (must be admin or organizer)
- Make sure to click "Save Changes" after deleting

### Drag-and-Drop Not Working

**Problem:** Can't reorder icebreakers

**Solutions:**
- On desktop: Click and hold the drag handle (six dots)
- On mobile: Long-press the card, then drag
- Make sure you're clicking/pressing on the drag handle, not the text
- Try refreshing the page if still not working
