## Frequently Asked Questions

### Can I change customization after publishing?

Yes! Update hero section, content, and icebreakers at any time. Changes are visible immediately to attendees.

### Do I need both desktop and mobile hero images?

It's highly recommended. If you only provide one, the other will display as blank space on that device type. For the best experience on all devices, provide both optimized images.

### What happens to old images when I upload new ones?

Old images are replaced. The previous file remains in storage but is no longer referenced by your event.

### Can I preview my changes before saving?

Not currently. Save your changes and view your event page to see the results. You can always edit again if needed.

### Will custom branding (colors, logos) be available in the future?

Custom branding features are planned for a future release! For now, focus on creating compelling hero images and content sections to make your event stand out.

### How do I remove a highlight or FAQ?

In the Branding settings, find the highlight or FAQ you want to remove and click the delete/remove button next to it.

### Can attendees add their own icebreakers?

No. Icebreakers are set by event organizers only. Attendees choose from the provided options or write their own custom message when connecting.

### Are there character limits for content sections?

- Hero description: No strict limit, but keep it brief (1-2 sentences recommended)
- Highlights: Title ~50 characters, Description ~200 characters
