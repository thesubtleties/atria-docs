## Best Practices

- Use distinct colors for easy visual identification

**Custom tiers:**
- Add specific tiers for your event (VIP, Presenting Sponsor, Media Partner)
- Keep tier IDs simple and lowercase
- Make display names descriptive

### Adding Sponsors

**Information to include:**
- Add a logo if available (sponsors without logos show a placeholder)
- Write a clear, concise description
- Include website URL for attendee reference
- Add social links for better engagement

**Contact information:**
- Keep contact details up to date
- Use for internal coordination only

### Organizing Display

**Ordering:**
- Place most important sponsors at the top of each tier
- Drag and drop to reorder as needed

**Active/inactive usage:**
- Mark sponsors inactive rather than deleting if they might return
- Keep inactive sponsors for historical records
- Activate sponsors as you confirm them
