# Making Connections

Networking is at the heart of every event. Atria makes it easy to discover attendees, send connection requests, and build your professional network across all your events.

## Overview

Atria's networking system allows you to:
- Browse and search event attendees
- Send connection requests with icebreaker messages
- Accept or decline connection requests
- Message your connections directly
- View all your connections across all events

All connections are built around events - you meet people at events, send requests during events, and those connections persist beyond the event.

## Discovering Attendees

### Accessing the Networking Area

1. Join an event as an attendee, speaker, or organizer
2. Navigate to the event
3. Click **Networking** in the event menu
4. Select the **Attendees** tab

You'll see a grid of all event attendees you can connect with.

### Attendee Information

Each attendee card shows:

- **Role badge** - Shows if they're a Speaker, Organizer, Admin, or Attendee
- **Name** - Full name (clickable if you're connected)
- **Title** - Job title (if they've filled it out)
- **Company** - Company name (if they've filled it out)
- **Social links** - LinkedIn, Twitter, Website, Email (if visible per their privacy settings)

To see someone's **bio**, you need to be connected and visit their profile page.

Use the **search bar** at the top to find specific people:
- Search by name
- Search by company
- Search by job title
- Search by speaker title (for speakers)

- **Organizers** - Shows admins and organizers

The filter clears your search and resets to the first page.

### Browsing More Attendees

### The Icebreaker System

Icebreakers are conversation starters that help break the ice when connecting with someone new. When you click "Connect," you'll see:

**If the event has icebreakers:**
- A list of 6-8 predefined icebreaker messages set by the event organizers
- Examples:
  - "Hi! I noticed we're both interested in similar sessions. Would you like to connect?"
  - "Hello! I saw your profile and would love to discuss technology with you."
  - "I'm looking to connect with others in the tech field. Would you be open to chatting?"
- Click on one to select it (it will highlight)
- Click **Send Request** to send your connection request with that message

**If the event has no icebreakers:**
- You'll see a message: "No icebreakers available for this event. Event organizers haven't set up icebreakers yet."
- You cannot send connection requests for this event
- Ask the event organizers to set up icebreakers

:::note Custom Messages
Currently, you must choose from the event's predefined icebreaker list. You cannot write completely custom messages when sending connection requests.
:::

### After Sending

Once you send a request:
- The recipient sees it in their **Requests** tab
- Your request includes:
  - Your profile information
  - The icebreaker message you selected
  - Which event you connected from
- The button on their card changes to **Pending**
- You cannot send another request to the same person until they respond

## Best Practices

### Discovering Connections

**Be specific with search:**
- Search for people by name if you met them
- Search by company to find people from specific organizations
- Use role filters to find speakers or organizers

**Review profiles before connecting:**
- Check their title and company for relevance
- Look at social links (if visible)
- After connecting, you can view their full profile including bio

### Sending Requests

**Choose relevant icebreakers:**
- Pick an icebreaker that matches why you're connecting
- If you're both interested in similar sessions, use that icebreaker
- Generic icebreakers work when you don't have a specific reason

**Send requests thoughtfully:**
- Don't spam connection requests to everyone
- Focus on people you want to genuinely connect with
- Remember that your profile is visible when you send requests

### Managing Requests

**Respond promptly:**
- Check your Requests tab regularly
- Accept requests from people you want to connect with
- Decline requests if you're not interested (it's okay to say no)

**Review before accepting:**
- Look at their profile and icebreaker message
- Make sure you want to stay connected after the event
- Remember that connections persist across all events

### Building Your Network

**Message your connections:**
- Start conversations with new connections
- Follow up after events
- Share relevant information or resources

**Update your profile:**
- Keep your bio current and relevant
- Add social links so connections can find you elsewhere
- Update your title and company when they change

## Troubleshooting

### Can't Send Connection Request

**Problem**: Connect button is disabled or greyed out

**Solutions**:
- Check if the event has icebreakers set up
- Make sure you haven't already sent a request to this person
- Verify you're not already connected
- Check your privacy settings - you may have connection requests disabled

### No Icebreakers Available

**Problem**: Modal says "No icebreakers available for this event"

**Solutions**:
- Contact the event organizers and ask them to set up icebreakers
- Icebreakers must be configured by event admins/organizers
- You cannot send requests without icebreakers

### Don't See Some Attendees

**Problem**: Expected to see someone in the attendee list but they're not there

**Solutions**:
- Check if you're using a role filter that excludes them
- Try searching by their name
- They may not have joined the event yet
- They may have been removed or banned from the event

### Request Stuck as Pending

**Problem**: Your connection request shows "Pending" for a long time

**Solutions**:
- The recipient hasn't responded yet
- They may not have checked their Requests tab
- They may have declined (you won't be notified)
- Be patient - some people check requests infrequently

### Can't Find Connection in Network

**Problem**: Accepted a connection but don't see them in My Network

**Solutions**:
- Refresh the page
- Check if you're searching/filtering
- Make sure the request was actually accepted (check for success notification)
- The connection may take a moment to appear

### Message Button Not Working

**Problem**: Clicking "Message" doesn't open a thread

**Solutions**:
- Refresh the page and try again
- Make sure you're actually connected (not just pending)
- Check your internet connection
- Try from a different page (Network vs Networking)
